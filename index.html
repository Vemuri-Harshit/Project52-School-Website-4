<h4>Middle-School</h4>

<br>

<p>At Open Minds, we emphasize on<br> 
    providing an inspiring school <br
    >environment which enables a shift<br>
     from rote methods to a course<br> 
     beyond textbooks.<br>
     The curriculum aims to provide <br>
     experiences and opportunities for <br>
     students to think differently,<br>
      analyze and evaluate independently <br>
      and foster a place where we can <br>
      soften subject boundaries...</p>

     School years. The transition is<br> 
    smooth and allows the students to<br>
     prepare for the school leaving <br>
     certificate examinations.<br>
